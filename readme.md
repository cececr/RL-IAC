### Saliency learning on the BioVision platform

Saliency learning on the foveated system called "BioVision". Learning is made possible through an object classifier applied to the foveal image. When an object is detected in the fovea, the visual aspect of this object is used to update the saliency model that is applied in the contextual image.
